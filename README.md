# DESIGN-AND-SIMULATION-OF-A-MOTOR-CONTROLLER-IN-VHDL-VHDL-AMS
Within the practical course, it is familiar with basic VHDL/VHDL-AMS descriptive elements. Based on this knowledge, a Motor Controller (MC), which is a mixedsignal component, shall be designed and simulated. The MC takes commands and Pulse-width modulation (PWM) parameters from Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) and translates them to electrical output signals. These output signals are driving one or two connected motors. These functionalities will be realised in several design and simulation steps within this practical lab. Hereby, this lab is subdivided in three digital (part I to III) teaching units and one analogue (part IV).
